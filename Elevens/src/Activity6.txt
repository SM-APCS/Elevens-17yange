Question 1.
5 of spades and 6 of clubs,5 of clubs and 6 of clubs. That's all

Question 2.
Yes, in order for the game to continue and for the player to win, the last three cards must be J, Q, and K,
because if you want to find a pair of cards that adds up to 11, the last one will be the odd one out that doesn't
belong and the player won't be able to clear the board and win the game.

Question 3.
The game kind of involves strategy, but a lot of it depends on luck of the draw, because sometimes
you just can't predict what cards will come up next but you can keep track of the cards that have already appeared
and calculate the probability of the next card being the card that you need. So, it kind of involves skill and it kind
of just involves the luck of the draw and the randomizer. It does matter which one is chosen because there is 
always a way to maximize the probability of there being another pair or three of a kind that can be
cleared the next turn but at some point it just all comes down to luck.
